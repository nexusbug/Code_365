# Code_365

I need a JOB please <br>
I still need a JOB <br>
I would be useful for society; you know, if I had a JOB <br>
JOB probably needs me too <br>
JOB please? <br>

About<br>
Doing a challenge, coding three sixty five<br>
There I hop on the train of Mr. Shiffman<br>
And code along rainbow colored railway<br>
One video each day, keeps the gray away<br>
